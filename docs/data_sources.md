## Notes

- The museum’s annual activity reports served as the **primary source of information** for this project.  
- Official press releases were used to **complement and clarify the data** when specific details were not available in the main reports.  
- Each annual report contains approximately **200 pages** of narrative, statistical, and financial information.  
- All data was manually extracted, cross-checked where possible, and transformed into an analytics-ready format.  
- Raw intermediate CSV files generated during data preparation are **intentionally excluded** from this repository to keep it lightweight and focused on analytics.
